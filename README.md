# Watermarking-Datatset-for-Claiming-Ownership

Presenting an approach to embed a watermark in Machine Learning  models in order to prevent reproduction of any proprietary deep learning algorithm/machine learning algorithm belonging to the intellectual property of the organisation that created it. Due to high consumption of monetary funds in developing such algorithms, there is a tendency of illegal reproduction of these intellectual properties.
In order to enforce copyright infringement, existing media content and publications came up with something known as watermark. Our watermarking scheme can be implemented for general classifications and can easily be accustomed to the current learning algorithms without much changes in the functionality of the ML algorithm.
Our goal is to poison the data and based on the accuracy score before and after poisoning of data, we wish to claim the ownership with respect to the condition of claiming ownership.
